<-- Introduction -->

Whether you’re building a small script or architecting a large-scale application, 
how you structure your code today determines how easy it is to adapt tomorrow. 
That’s where the SOLID principles come in.

If you follow these principles while writing your application, 
your code will not become a mess when it grows very large,
and it will be very easy for you to add new features to it.
	
Full Form of the SOLID principle:
    S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
    L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
    I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
    D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
