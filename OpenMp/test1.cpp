/*
Syntax of OpenMP

OpenMP uses compiler directives to indicate the parallel sections of the code. 
The directives are preceded by the "#pragma" keyword and take the form:

#pragma omp <directive> [clause[,clause]...]
OpenMP directives:

"parallel": create a team of threads that execute the enclosed code block in parallel.
"for": splits a loop into smaller iterations that can be executed in parallel by different threads.
"sections": split the enclosed code block into different sections that can be executed in parallel.
"single": specifies that a code block should be executed by only one thread.
"critical": specifies that a code block should be executed by only one thread at a time.
"atomic": specifies that a variable should be accessed atomically.

ex: #pragma omp parallel
{
    // code block executes parallel.
}
    
OpenMP clause : 

#pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum)
openMP clause that helps safely combine (reduce) values computed by multiple threads into a single result, 
 without race conditions. supported operators( +, -, *, min, max, &)

#pragma omp parallel private(i)
Each thread gets its own uninitialized copy of the variable.

int x = 5;
#pragma omp parallel firstprivate(x)
Each thread gets its own copy of the variable, but it is initialized with the master threadâ€™s value.
Every thread starts with x = 5, but can modify independently.

#pragma omp parallel shared(sum)
All threads share the same instance of the variable.
Must protect with atomic, critical, or reduction to avoid race conditions.
